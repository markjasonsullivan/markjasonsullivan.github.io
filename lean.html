            <h1>Lean = IE + UX</h1>

            <p>Hi there! This is my earth. I am skilled in 2 disciplines that you may think are on two sides of the planet, but I can assure you,
              are both revolved around the principle of lean. Lean Manufacturing incomposes my degree in Industrial Engineering, while quickly
              testing assumptions through MVPs and user research are where Lean Startup methodlogy applies to my UX Design.</p>
            <p>Explore the rest of the planets in my solar-system. Each one will take you through a quick journey into my greatest accomplishments -- so far. Safe travels!</p>
